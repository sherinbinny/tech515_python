# ----------------------------
# While Loops
# ----------------------------

# The task
# Create a new file named 'while_loops.py' or similar.
# Initialise x with the value of 0
# Create a while statement so that it loops while x is less than 10. Everytime it loops it should:
# Print the value of x to the screen in an f-string
# Increment (add 1 to x)
# Running this code should produce:
# print x -> 0
# print x -> 1
# print x -> 2
# print x -> 3
# print x -> 4
# print x -> 5
# print x -> 6
# print x -> 7
# print x -> 8
# print x -> 9

x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(f"print x -> {x}")
    x += 1

# Once your code works, find out what happens when you run the code if you comment out the first line which initialises 'x'.
# NameError: name 'x' is not defined
# Write a brief comment on the line before the code which increments x to explain what would happen if you don't increment x.
# # If we don't increment x here, x will stay the same forever causing infinite loop
# Copy and paste your working 'while loop' underneath the 'while loop'. Modify the second copy of the 'while loop' so that it breaks out of the loop when x equals 4.
# The output should be:
# print x -> 0
# print x -> 1
# print x -> 2
# print x -> 3
# print x -> 4

x = 0
while x < 10:
    print(f"print x -> {x}")
    if x == 4:
        break
    x += 1
