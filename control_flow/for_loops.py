# ----------------------------
# For Loops
# ----------------------------

# Starting code to put at the top:

list_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
embedded_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
dict_data = {1: {"name": "Bronson", "money": "$0.05"}, 2: {"name": "Masha", "money": "$3.66"},
             3: {"name": "Roscoe", "money": "$1.14"}}

# 1. Loop through a list
# Under the starting code, write a for loop to print the double of each number in the list 'list_data'.
# It should loop through the numbers in list_data - each item in the list should be called 'num' (for number)
# Inside the loop, it should print out the double of each number in the list.

for num in list_data:
    print(num * 2)

# 2. Loop through the 'embedded_lists' list
# Write another for loop to print the items inside 'embedded_lists'. Each item in the list should be called 'data'
# It should output this to the screen:
# [1, 2, 3]
# [4, 5, 6]

for data in embedded_lists:
    print(data)

# 3. Loop through the lists embedded inside a list
# We need to access the data within the lists, so now we need an embedded loop. Create another loop inside the 'embedded_lists' for loop to list the individual items in the lists.
# You should end up with this output:
# [1, 2, 3]
# 1
# 2
# 3
# [4, 5, 6]
# 4
# 5
# 6

for data in embedded_lists:
    print(data)
    for item in data:
        print(item)

# 4. Loop through a dictionary
# Write another for loop to loop through the dictionary 'dict_data'. It should print the keys to the screen like this:
# 1
# 2
# 3

for key in dict_data:
    print(key)

# 5. Loop through a dictionary and print its values
# Write another for loop to loop through the dictionary 'dict_data'. Use to the dictionary's value() method to print the value for each key in the dictionary. Output should be:
# {'name': 'Bronson', 'money': '$0.05'}
# {'name': 'Masha', 'money': '$3.66'}
# {'name': 'Roscoe', 'money': '$1.14'}

for value in dict_data.values():
    print(value)

# 6. Loop to print the values of the dictionary items inside a dictionary
# Copy and paste the last “for loop” as a starting point for this loop. Generate an embedded “for loop” (a loop within a loop) to extract and print the values within the dictionary of each item in the dictionary. Output should be:
# Bronson
# $0.05
# Masha
# $3.66
# Roscoe
# $1.14

for value in dict_data.values():
    for inner_value in value.values():
        print(inner_value)

# 7. Loop to print specific values of the dictionary items inside a dictionary
# Copy and paste the last “for loops” as a starting point for this loop, however, this time only print out only print out the money values.
# You may work out a way to simplify your code so that you can do with only one loop (don’t worry if you can’t).  Output should be:
# $0.05
# $3.66
# $1.14

for value in dict_data.values():
    for inner_key, inner_value in value.items():
        if inner_key == "money":
            print(inner_value)

for value in dict_data.values():
    print(value["money"])

# 8. Loop through a list with a nested if statement
# Write another loop to loop through the items in 'list_data' and include a nested (indented) if statement inside the loop so that when it loops it checks the number/item in list:
# if the number is less than 3, it prints 'less than 3'
# if the number equals 3, it prints 'I found three'
# if the number is greater than 3, it prints 'greater than 3'
# Output should be:
# less than 3
# less than 3
# I found three
# greater than 3
# greater than 3
# greater than 3

for num in list_data:
    if num < 3:
        print("less than 3")
    elif num == 3:
        print("I found three")
    else:
        print("greater than 3")
