# Working with a Dictionary
# ----------------------------

# Make a dictionary called "student_1" containing the following information:
# name: susan
# stream: tech-
# completed_lessons: 4 (should be saved as an integer not a string)
# completed_lesson_names: value should be list of these 3 items: "variables", "data_types", "set up"

# Explain how a dictionary saves/structures data? Example, what does each value need to be accompanied/associated with?
# Print the dictionary to the screen
# Print its data type to the screen to check it's a dictionary
# Print the value for the key-value pair having the key "stream"
# Print the value for 'completed_lesson_names' - check you can see the list of 3 items
# Print the data type for the value for 'completed_lesson_names' - check it is a list
# Print the first element/item in the list of 'completed_lesson_names' (should output "variables")
# Change the value of "completed_lessons" to 3 (an integer not string). Make sure you change was successful by printing your dictionary to the screen again.
# Delete "data_types" from the list under the key 'completed_lesson_names'
# Use the keys() method on your dictionary to list all the keys
