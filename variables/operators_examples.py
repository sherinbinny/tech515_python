# OPERATORS
# ----------------------------

# What is the difference between an operator and operand?
# Operator: the symbol that performs an operation.
# Operand: the value the operator acts on.
x = 5
y = 2

# Here is your starting code:
# x = 5
# y = 1
# Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use operators to:
# add
# subtract
# multiply
# divide
# find the remainder part of the division

print("Add:", x + y)
print("Subtract:", x - y)
print("Multiply:", x * y)
print("Divide:", x / y)
print("Remainder:", x % y)

# Add code to demonstrate that you understand how use comparison operators to:
# greater than
# less than
# check if equal
# check if not equal
# greater than or equal to
# less than or equal to

print(">", x > y)
print("<", x < y)
print("==", x == y)
print("!=", x != y)
print(">=", x >= y)
print("<=", x <= y)
